## 🚀 About Me

High-performance **Software Engineer (Expected May 2026)** with a **3.6 GPA** and hands-on experience across **systems programming, fintech infrastructure, and AI automation**.

I specialize in **Java, C++, and Python**, with a proven track record of:
- ⚡ Reducing backend latency by **35%**
- 🧠 Building real-time, distributed systems (VR, robotics, marketplaces)
- 🧱 Designing resilient microservices, data contracts, and CI/CD pipelines

Comfortable operating close to the metal (Linux, C/C++) as well as at scale (cloud-native, containerized systems). I thrive in **mission-critical environments** and high-ownership engineering roles.
